"""Blend multi-source signals into quality / fraud / confidence + a grade.

Design principle: no single source is trusted on its own. The VLM can be fooled
by a doctored photo; the buyer's stated reason can be false; history is only a
prior. We combine them with explicit weights, cross-check the stated reason
against what the VLM sees, and lower confidence when sources disagree or data is
missing. Every number is accompanied by an explainable breakdown stored on the
assessment so the (deferred) decision engine and auditors can re-reason.
